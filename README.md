The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then.The names and usernames have been given codes to avoid any privacy concerns. We are given the following information:

Location
TweetAt
Original Tweet
Sentiment
User Name
Screen Name Variables Description Answer Here
UserName: This column contains the username of the person who posted the tweet.

ScreenName: This column contains the screen name or handle of the user who posted the tweet.

Location: This column contains the location of the user who posted the tweet. This could be their city, state, country, or any other geographic location that they have specified in their Twitter profile.

TweetAt: This column contains the date and time when the tweet was posted.

OriginalTweet: This column contains the actual text of the tweet that was posted.

Sentiment: This column contains the sentiment label assigned to the tweet. This label could be positive, negative,extremely positive,extremely negative neutral, depending on the sentiment analysis algorithm used to classify the tweet.


CONCLUSION

1. For both the Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques, we applied 8 models, including Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV, Decision Tree Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent, KNN, SVM, Multinomial Navies Bayes, and Bernoulli Navies Bayes Classifier.performance.


2. We come to the conclusion that the machine produces the most accurate results with the stochastic gradient descent (count vectorizer) model, which has an accuracy of 79.78%, and the logistic regression(count vectorizer) with anaccuracy of 78.71% with grid search CV (TF/ID vectorizer) model, which has an accuracy of 78.55%.

3.Repeating the analysis in the future and comparing it to the current sentimental analysis will allow us to determine the impact of the initiatives on the ground.
